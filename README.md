This is my first actual C++ project other than the simple console calculators etc. This is a very unoptimized and bad game so you shouldn't learn from this for example the collisions are messed up, the entity system uses 4 different std::vectors for each entity and i can keep going. but if you somehow want to compile this: Make sure you have MinGW installed go to /build and type in "mingw32-make" (without the quotation marks) and the game should compile.
